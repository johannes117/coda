# Sample Task Project

This is a simple Python project designed to test Coda's code editing capabilities.

## Overview

The project contains:
- A `Calculator` class with basic arithmetic operations
- Utility functions for mathematical calculations
- Comprehensive test suite
- Example usage in the main module

## Features

### Calculator Class
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Operation history tracking
- Error handling for division by zero

### Utility Functions
- `calculate_average()` - Calculate average of numbers
- `find_max()` - Find maximum value in a list
- `calculate_circle_area()` - Calculate circle area from radius

## Usage

Run the example:
```bash
python main.py
```

Run tests:
```bash
pytest test_main.py
```

## Testing Coda

This project is perfect for testing Coda's capabilities:

### Example Tasks to Try

1. **Add new functionality:**
   - "Add a power function to the Calculator class"
   - "Create a function to calculate the factorial of a number"
   - "Add a method to calculate standard deviation"

2. **Fix bugs:**
   - "Fix the division by zero handling"
   - "Make the average function handle negative numbers correctly"

3. **Refactor code:**
   - "Refactor the Calculator class to use an enum for operations"
   - "Add type hints to all functions"
   - "Extract the history functionality into a separate class"

4. **Add tests:**
   - "Write tests for edge cases in the utility functions"
   - "Add integration tests for the Calculator class"
   - "Create performance tests for large number lists"

5. **Documentation:**
   - "Add detailed docstrings to all methods"
   - "Create API documentation"
   - "Add usage examples to the README"

## Expected Coda Responses

When working with this project, Coda should:
- Read and understand the existing code structure
- Suggest appropriate implementations following the existing patterns
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Maintain consistent code style and documentation
- Handle edge cases and error conditions
